# Engineering Workflow Router

Use this skill before doing engineering work. Its job is to choose the mandatory workflow, not to implement the task.

## Routing Protocol

1. Classify the task:
   - `new_feature`
   - `bug_fix`
   - `pure_refactor`
   - `domain_modeling`
   - `glue_coding`
   - `design_review`
   - `code_review`
   - `review_feedback`
   - `verification`
   - `branch_finish`
   - `commit_or_pr`
2. Identify risk dimensions:
   - domain ambiguity or business rules
   - df-glue-coding fit: existing CRUD/page/endpoint/adapter/pattern likely covers most structure
   - behavior change
   - existing behavior preservation
   - public API, HTTP, security, validation, or serialization boundary
   - persistence, transactions, ordering, pagination, external side effects
   - failing tests, production bug, or unclear root cause
   - multi-module work that can be split
   - long-running, multi-turn, interruption-prone, or resumed work
3. Select the required skills.
4. State the selected workflow before proceeding.
5. If a selected skill is unavailable, say which one is missing and use the closest available workflow.

## Skill Selection

- Use `df-resumable-workflow-guard` when the task may span multiple turns or sessions, exceed about 30 minutes, resume after interruption, approach context limits, involve several workflow stages, or need checkpoint/handoff evidence.
- Use `df-ddd-event-storming-design` when requirements contain non-trivial business language, domain events, commands, policies, aggregates, read models, or unclear business boundaries.
- Use `df-glue-coding` after domain ambiguity is resolved or intentionally thin, when implementation should reuse local project material such as CRUD/page patterns, reference examples, endpoints, adapters, handlers, projections, tests, imports/exports, or other repeatable structures.
- Use `df-ddd-to-tdd-handoff` after a DDD design is confirmed and the user wants implementation slices, tests, or development planning.
- Use `df-implementation-planning` for multi-step implementation, refactoring, risky changes, or any task whose safe execution needs more than one red/green slice.
- Use `df-executing-implementation-plan` when following an existing plan or after writing one.
- Use `df-tdd-skill` when writing or changing executable behavior, fixing bugs, characterizing existing behavior, or doing behavior-preserving refactors.
- Use `df-spring-web-boundaries` when changing Java/Spring controllers, REST endpoints, request/response mapping, validation, security, uploads/downloads, exports, or service/controller boundaries.
- Use `df-systematic-debugging` when a test fails unexpectedly, a bug report lacks a proven root cause, or a proposed fix is based on guessing.
- Use `df-parallel-agent-orchestration` when independent modules, plan review, implementation, and review can be split across non-overlapping contexts.
- Use `df-requesting-code-review` after the main implementation is complete and before final handoff or PR.
- Use `df-receiving-code-review` when addressing review comments.
- Use `df-verification-before-completion` before claiming the task is complete.
- Use `df-finishing-development-branch` before committing, pushing, opening a PR, or preparing a branch handoff.

## Output Format

```text
当前任务类型：<classification>
主要风险：<risk list>
必须使用的 skill：
1. <skill> - <reason>
2. <skill> - <reason>
执行顺序：
1. <workflow step>
2. <workflow step>
暂不使用：
- <skill> - <reason>
```

Keep the routing concise. After routing, immediately follow the selected skills.

## Default Chains

- Long or resumed task: `df-resumable-workflow-guard` -> selected inner workflow -> checkpoint updates -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- New domain feature: `df-ddd-event-storming-design` -> `df-glue-coding` when local patterns exist -> `df-ddd-to-tdd-handoff` -> `df-implementation-planning` -> `df-executing-implementation-plan` with `df-tdd-skill` -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Glue-style implementation: DDD gate if business meaning is unclear -> `df-glue-coding` -> `df-implementation-planning` -> `df-executing-implementation-plan` with `df-tdd-skill` when behavior changes -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Bug fix: `df-systematic-debugging` -> `df-tdd-skill` -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Pure refactor: `df-implementation-planning` -> `df-tdd-skill` characterization -> `df-executing-implementation-plan` -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Spring endpoint change: `df-tdd-skill` + `df-spring-web-boundaries` -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Review feedback: `df-receiving-code-review` -> targeted verification -> `df-verification-before-completion`.
- Commit or PR: `df-verification-before-completion` -> `df-finishing-development-branch`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not skip routing because a task looks small unless it is documentation-only, formatting-only, or a direct question.
- Do not begin production-code edits when routing selected modeling, planning, TDD, or debugging first.
- Do not use DDD as a coding plan by itself; bridge confirmed domain design through `df-ddd-to-tdd-handoff`.
- Do not let Glue Coding bypass DDD. If a CRUD-looking task hides business rules, use local patterns only as discovery input until the DDD gate is confirmed.
- Do not invent structure for glue-style work before checking local patterns and recording the selected pattern plus delta.
- Do not claim completion without `df-verification-before-completion` for engineering changes.
- Respect user-owned changes in the worktree. Never revert unrelated edits.
