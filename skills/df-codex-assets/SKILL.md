# DevFlow Codex Asset Bootstrap

This internal skill carries the bootstrap script and expected hash for DevFlow's managed Codex runtime assets.

The SessionStart hook runs `scripts/df-codex-assets.ts hydrate` before the runtime hook scripts. The script verifies the managed asset hash and, when an installed plugin mirror is missing those assets, downloads the versioned files from the matching GitHub tag.
